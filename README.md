## Scheduler

Sometimes you need to run things.   On a schedule.   You deserve better than cron.

(Candidates: nomad, dkron)

## Remote access

ssh is awesome.   Gravitational Teleport is awesomer.

## Web shell

Sometimes you just want a shell.   This is the just-shell you want.

# How?

Docker compose or (eventually) Kubernetes.   Stay tuned.
